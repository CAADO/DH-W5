for this week, I decided to do the podcast stuff and the storymap stuff.

The techical side of the postcast setup went well, but my first roadblock came in how to go through 5 miniuts of content without some horrific breakdown in speech. 

Step one: scripting right around 750 words. As I don't really need pauses for the audience and I'm going to be editing this project, the script should be on the longer side for a 5m speech.

Step two: editing it down a bit. This really involved saying to myself, and trying to cut or move parts that don't verbally flow well.

Step three: record. After two failed attempts around 1min in, I decided instead that I would record by paragraph, stopping the recording every time I finished. This worked a whole lot better, as it also allows me to cut failed paragraphs.

After a couple fails, I hit the end of recording. Next is editing.

Step four: editing. As I'm using a somewhat poor mic, (no pop filter or anything like that) I figure there isn't much point trying to do a lot of level editing or smoothing out my voice, the general audio quality just isn't good enough for that. Instead, as per my style, I just have to 'youtube edit' the paragprahs, hunting out and cutting dead air and silences. Audible has a command to make the first pass, and then I make a second one.

Step 5: suffer through my own voice. Being able to listen to yourself talk must be the final form of self-acceptace. I have not yet reached this, and so I fail this step partway thouugh, but the doc seems fine.

and we're done with the audio section.
